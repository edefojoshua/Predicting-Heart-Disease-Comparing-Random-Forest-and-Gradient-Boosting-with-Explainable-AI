This modelling uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to build Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for predicting heart health status (heart disease) based on features such as cholesterol level, blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar. It begins by loading the dataset, handling missing values. The dataset is then split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. Hyperparameter tuning is performed, and the models are trained using the optimal values with 1000 trees. The models are then evaluated on the test dataset. The predictions for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models yield accuracies of 73.33% and 70%, respectively. Additionally, SHAP (explainable AI) analysis revealed that cholesterol has the most positive influence on heart status with a score of 230, followed by maximum heart rate during exercise with a score of 160.
