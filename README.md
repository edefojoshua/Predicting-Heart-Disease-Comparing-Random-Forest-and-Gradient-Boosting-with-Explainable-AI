This modelling project used the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to build Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for predicting heart health status (presence of heart disease) based on features such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar. The process begins by loading the dataset and handling any missing values. The data was then split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets. Hyperparameter tuning was performed, and the models were trained using optimal hyperparameters with 1000 trees. The models were evaluated on the test dataset, with Random Forest achieving an accuracy of 73.33% and Gradient Boosting achieving an accuracy of 70%.

Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis provides interpretability for the models. A local interpretation for a sample revealed that cholesterol has the most positive influence on heart status with a score of 230, followed by maximum heart rate during exercise with a score of 160. The global interpretation showed that calcium intake has the greatest influence on predicting heart disease, followed by age.
